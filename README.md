# Honors Data Thesis
My work originates from the idea of polling public opinion of the 2020 presidential election using social media data. My main question for this project is: can social media replicate or beat the accuracy of national polls and properly forecast the popular vote of the election? In practice, I am collecting Twitter data using the Twitter API and analyzing this data through a combination of sentiment and structural analysis. The sentiment analysis extracts the preference of the social media post through NLP on a Tweet's text and the structural analysis weights Tweet characteristics through machine learning.
