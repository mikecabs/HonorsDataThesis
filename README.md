# Honors Data Thesis
Over the course of my senior year, I have been conducting independent research for my data science thesis. The topic has been refined to polling public opinion of candidates throughout the 2020 presidential election using social media data. Due to the difficulty of collecting social media data, this project has been simplified to only use Twitter data. The main question for this project is: can social media replicate or outperform the accuracy of national polls in predicting the vote share of the 2020 US presidential election?

In sum, this research proposes a new method for predicting elections which combines sentiment, from NLP on the text of tweets, and structural data with aggregate polling, a time series analysis, and a special focus on Twitter users critical to the election. While this method performed worse than its baseline of polling predictions, it is inconclusive whether this is an accurate method for predicting elections due to the scarcity of data. More research and more data are needed to accurately measure this methodâ€™s overall effectiveness.
